### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Luis Gonzalez, a software developer with over 10 years of experience producing and updating SaaS systems, optimizing structures and processes to accomplish customer targets and promote company loyalty.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on LogicCadence as a Full-Stack developer.
- ðŸŒ± I'm a Information System Analyst and I'm currently finishing the 5th year of Information Systems Engineering at UCP.

I started programming at 19 years old and since there I never stop. I love discover, test and try new technologies and programming languages and I try to keep myself updated.

In my first steps i started with PHP, Html, Css and Mysql creating little pages and playing with the code. Then I discover codeigniter, my first framework that open the doors to develop an University page. In that job, I learned SQL Server, .NET, Azure
