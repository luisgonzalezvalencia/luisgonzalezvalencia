### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Luis Gonzalez, a software developer with over 10 years of experience producing and updating SaaS systems, optimizing structures and processes to accomplish customer targets and promote company loyalty.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on LogicCadence as a Full-Stack developer.
- ðŸŒ± I'm a Information System Analyst and I'm currently finishing the 5th year of Information Systems Engineering at UCP.

I started programming at 19 years old and since there I never stop. I love discover, test and try new technologies and programming languages and I try to keep myself updated.

In my first steps i started with PHP, HTML, CSS and MySQL creating web sites and playing with the code. Then I discover codeigniter, my first framework that open the doors to develop an University page and blog for them. In that job, I learned SQL Server, .NET, C# and a lot of other stacks. Also I learn how work with Azure and deploy the different systems there improving the infrastructure of the "Digital Education" department where I worked. (https://www.ucp.edu.ar)

After 5 years I started to work with a partner as a freelancer for many clients and different needs and we founded VencejosLab. (www.vencejoslab.com)
Then a new opportunity arises with a company from Costa Rica. In that company I worked mainly with .C#, VueJs and with Ionic Framework and Angular developing mobile applications. 
One of the projects that I am proud of and that improved the internal processes in said company, was having incorporated CI/CD to automate the integration of our repositories and deploy the products and services automatically. (https://wolksoftcr.com)

After 3 years there, my journey took me to where I am, working mostly with Angular and Python as a full-stack developer. (https://logiccadence.com)
