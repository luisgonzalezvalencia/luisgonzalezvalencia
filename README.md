### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Luis Gonzalez, a software developer with over 10 years of experience. My gig? Crafting and tweaking SaaS systems to make customers happy and keep companies thriving.

- ðŸ”­ Right now, I'm diving deep into coding at Provisions Group (former LogicCadence) as a Senior Software Engineer.
- ðŸŒ± I'm a Information System Engineer.

I started programming at 19 years old and since there I never stop. I love discovering, testing and working with new technologies and programming languages and I try to stay up to date.

My journey began with the basics like PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, creating websites and experimenting with code. Then I discovered CodeIgniter, my first framework, which opened the doors to developing a university website and blog. In that role, I learned SQL Server, .NET, C#, and various other stacks. Additionally, I gained experience in working with Azure and deploying different systems, enhancing the infrastructure of the "Digital Education" department where I worked. (https://www.ucp.edu.ar)

After 5 years I started working with a partner as a freelancer for many clients and different needs and we founded VencejosLab. (www.vencejoslab.com)
Then a new opportunity arises with a company from Costa Rica. In that company I worked mainly with .C#, VueJs, Ionic Framework and Angular developing mobile applications. 
One of my proudest achievements was setting up CI/CD to automate our work. (https://wolksoftcr.com)

After 3 years there, my journey took me to where I am, working mostly with Angular and Django (Python) as a full-stack developer. (https://provisionsgroup.com , https://logiccadence.com)
